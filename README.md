This assignment is meant for you to practice what we have learned in class in the first four weeks of
the semester. A lot of the design decision have been taken for you, but it is important for you to ask
yourself why each choice has been made and whether there could be a better way of doing it. Some
of our choices were influenced by the intention of having you practice most of what you have learned
in class. Others, were dictated by our need to be able to fully test your assignments. Finally, we will
not be grading your work on efficiency for the first assignments, but your implementation decisions
can affect how efficient the code for this assignment is. Try to keep this in mind while coding.
Make sure to ask yourselves why certain modifiers (private, public, static,...) were used and if
you would have made the same decisions. We hope that the assignment will help you appreciate
the importance of class design. This is of course just a taste, you will learn much more about it in
COMP 303. As mentioned in class, we suggest you take the time to draw out a class diagram. This
should help you develop a clear picture of the relationship between all these classes.
